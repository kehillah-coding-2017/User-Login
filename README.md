# User-Login
Small challenge for SQL and user authentication

## SQL
You can learn SQL easily from [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql) or [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/).

## SQLite
The [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) library comes with python and allows you to set up a simple database on your filesystem very easily.

## Challenge
Create a simple application that allows a user to register, login/logout, and saves their info in a database. Storing passwords as plaintext is BAD, so check out some [cryptographic hashing algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function). Fun fact: [git relies on these functions](http://blog.thoughtram.io/git/2014/11/18/the-anatomy-of-a-git-commit.html) to do what it does.

## Getting Started
This repository includes some starter code. It includes a [while loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop) right [here](https://github.com/kehillah-coding-2017/User-Login/blob/9e219d43246f79ddb2c70c5077462ca94d3cce52/main.py#L5) that prompts the user for input. To exit this infinite loop on your computer, hit `ctrl + c`. You are not required to use this starter code.

To attempt this challenge assignment, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository and clone from your own account. Make a pull request to submit your solution. All of this will be public.
